\begin{itemize}
  \item Add another large feature: Delete Memory functionality

  \item Update logic to remove memory from both the list and localStorage
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Delete button (X) appears next to each memory
  \item Clicking delete removes the memory from the UI
  \item Updated localStorage to persist deletion across refresh
\end{itemize}

\section*{Tasks \& Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Update JavaScript to attach delete functionality to each memory
  \item Remove memory from the in-memory array and localStorage
  \item Update the UI dynamically after deletion
  \item Prepare for future enhancements (e.g. Edit memory)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Test Objectives (for Snapshot 3)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Deleting a memory removes it from the list
  \item Deleted memory is no longer in localStorage after refresh
  \item UI updates instantly without page reload
  \item Deleting multiple entries works as expected
\end{itemize}
